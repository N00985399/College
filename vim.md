## Command Mode

### KEYBINDS ARE CASE SENSITIVE!


``esc`` - Enters Command Mode

``a`` - Append Mode (inserts to the right of the cursor

``i`` - Insert Mode (Overwrites the character at the cursor)

``O`` - Opens line above current line.

``o`` - Opens line below the current line.

``ZZ`` - Saves & Exits.

``x`` - deletes one character

``dd`` - deletes 1 line.

``LEFT RIGHT`` - Arrow Keys allow you to move within your lines, can only be used within command mode, otherwise character input is messed up.

``:`` - Instructs Vim to accept multiple characters within command mode, to allow the input of actual commands. (Such as ``:save ...``)

``:save [name | name.ext]`` - Saves Vim File with custom name, and or name with a custom file extension. (Such as ``:save systemAudit.txt`` or ``:save who_am_i``)
